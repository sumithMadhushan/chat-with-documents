This is a sample project written in Python with Natural Language Processing

 Use the pre-trained question answering model from Hugging Face - this is a Natural Language Processing****

# Hugging Face

Hugging Face is more than an emoji: it's an open source data science and machine learning platform.

Hugging Face is especially important because of the "we have no moat" vibe of AI. No big tech company will solve AI; it will be solved by open source collaboration. And that's what Hugging Face sets out to do: provide the tools to involve as many people as possible in shaping the artificially intelligent tools of the future.

# Hugging Face's model library have over 200,000 models available, you'll be able to work with things like:

Natural language processing, including tasks like translation, summarization, and text generation. These features are the core of what, for example, OpenAI's GPT-3 offers in ChatGPT.

Audio lets you complete tasks like automatic speech recognition, voice activity detection, or text-to-speech.

Computer vision is anything that helps computers see the real world and understand it. These tasks include depth estimation, image classification, and image-to-image. This is key for self-driving cars, for instance.

Multimodal models work with multiple types of data (text, images, audio) and can also render multiple kinds of output.

These models aren't here just for show. Hugging Face's Transformer library lets you connect to these models, send tasks, and receive outputs without having to set them up yourself. You can also download models, train them with your own data, or quickly create a Space. This makes it easy to find models to complete any kind of task, connect them with your own code, and start getting results.
